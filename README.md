### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my github profile.
I'm currently an engineering student at CESI Arras in France.
I'm particularly interested in learning new things and using bleeding edge technologies.

I also love Go and I'm learning it the best I can to perhaps get an intership.

If you have any question or just want to discuss anything, feel free to contact me either on discord or twitter.

Have a nice day
